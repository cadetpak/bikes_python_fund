Simple Python fundamentals assignment. Heavily commented.
Requires creation of "Bike" class that takes 2 parameters (price, max speed) and sets miles to 0.
"Bike" class should have 3 methods: display info, ride, and reverse. 
Display info should show price, max speed, and current miles logged for each Bike.
Ride should increase miles by 10.
Reverse should decrease miles by 5, with check to avoid negative outcome.

Create 3 instances of "Bike" class and chain methods.
